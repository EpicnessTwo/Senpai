-- About LogViewer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this tool is to make an HTML display of the Logs made by the 
Logging plugin for Phergie stored in a database.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install this, simply copy the contents of this directory into whatever
directory you want this to run under.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The only configuration needed at this point in time is to edit the database
variables in the top of the index.php to be the appropriate values.

Specifically point to the Settings.php you are using, so that this script
can read in your logging configuration.

NOTE: This is very simple/raw code, it doesn't do as complicated as config
parsing as Phergie itself does.  Be warned.

NOTE: If you are installing this on a different machine than the one that
your Phergie install is living on, simply comment out the rough 'reading of
the configuration file', and manually set the connection variables.

Stuff may get more complicated in the future ;)  But this is meant to be 
simple for now.
