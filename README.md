Senpai the IRC Bot
=================

Originally written by the Phergie Team, this is a modified PHP IRC Bot that has been worked on by EpicKitty  
Currently, the bot has a few commands added but loads more needs adding!

Current Features:
 - Git manipulation (Requires "git")
 - Permission System
 - Configureable Output System
 - Formatting Tools For Output Manipulation

As most of it is written in a linux box, some things may not fully work on windows. I can't fully help this :<
